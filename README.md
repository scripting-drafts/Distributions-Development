| **Packaging**           | Scripts to create Linux packages (deb, RPM), Docker images, and cross-platform binaries            |
| **Build Automation**    | CI/CD pipelines using GitHub Actions; automated versioning, artifact generation, distribution       |
| **Distribution Hosting**| Upload scripts to package managers and S3/Artifactory; configured public & private distribution    |
| **Dependency Management** | Tools to lock versions, handle transitive dependencies, and resolve conflicts automatically       |
| **Testing & QA**        | Smoke tests for installation; verification scripts across platforms; clean-up and audit routines    |
| **Documentation**       | Auto-generated release notes, CHANGELOG maintenance, version badges, and usage metadata insertion  |
| **Versioning Strategies** | Semantic versioning scripts, changelog parsers, and tag management for consistent releases          |
